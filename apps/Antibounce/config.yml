description: "Ball bouncing game"
long-description: "You play as an infinitely bouncing ball attempting to nab as many coins as possible for a great high score. As the levels increase, so does the speed of the game. The problem is that spikes will appear on a random tile in the map every 5 seconds. At any given time, shields can spawn which protect you from dying once. Beginning on level 4 rockets that home in on you will spawn. Furthermore, gravity itself will flip every so often, so be careful."
