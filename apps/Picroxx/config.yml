long-description: "Picroxx! is a Picross homebrew clone for the Nintendo 3DS console. For those who don't know what Picross is, it's a series of Sudoku-ish puzzle games in which you have to fill up spaces to discover a hidden picture. It gives you numeric hints for each row and column and you have to figure out which spaces to fill, leaving a gap of at least 1 cell between every \"line\" of filled cells."
