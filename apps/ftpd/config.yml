long-description: "FTP server for the 3ds, enabling you to easily transfer files to and from your 3ds using a FTP client on your computer. Supports multiple simultaneous clients. The 3DS itself only appears to support enough sockets to perform 4-5 simultaneous data transfers, so it will help if you limit your FTP client to this many parallel requests."
